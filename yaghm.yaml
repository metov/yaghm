# To activate, run in the repo root: yaghm enable .

  # The value of enable is the command that will be executed by the hook
  - enable: black --check .
    # Additional keys like install are so that we can do: yaghm install .
    install: pip install black

  - enable: protect_branch master
    install: pip install metovhooks
    # Custom commands: This one will be executed by: yaghm update
